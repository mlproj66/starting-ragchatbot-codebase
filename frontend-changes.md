# Frontend Changes - Enhanced Testing Framework

## Overview
Enhanced the existing testing framework for the RAG system with comprehensive API testing infrastructure. This implementation focuses primarily on backend API testing but includes frontend-related testing for static file serving.

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)
- **Added httpx dependency** for FastAPI testing client support
- **Enhanced pytest configuration** with:
  - Clear test discovery patterns and paths
  - Organized output formatting (`-v`, `--tb=short`)
  - Comprehensive warning filters to reduce test noise
  - Test markers for categorization (unit, integration, api, slow)

### 2. Test Fixtures (`backend/tests/conftest.py`)
- **Mock RAG System fixture** - Comprehensive mock for API testing
- **Test FastAPI app fixture** - Clean test app without static file dependencies
- **Test client fixtures** - Both basic and full-featured test clients
- **Temporary frontend directory fixture** - Creates test HTML/CSS/JS files
- **Full test app with static serving** - Complete app with temporary frontend files
- **Sample API responses fixture** - Consistent test data

### 3. API Endpoint Tests (`backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py`)
- **POST /api/query endpoint tests:**
  - Valid requests with/without session_id
  - Input validation and error handling
  - Response format verification
  - Session management testing
  - Large query and special character handling

- **GET /api/courses endpoint tests:**
  - Course statistics retrieval
  - Response format validation
  - Error handling scenarios

- **Static file serving tests:**
  - HTML, CSS, JS file serving
  - 404 handling for missing files
  - API route precedence over static files

- **Integration and edge case tests:**
  - CORS configuration validation
  - Content-type header verification
  - Concurrent request handling
  - Error scenarios and malformed requests

### 4. Static File Mounting Solution
- **Created separate test app factory** that optionally mounts static files
- **Temporary frontend directory creation** for isolated testing
- **Dependency injection pattern** for clean test isolation
- **Resolved import issues** by avoiding production app dependency

## Frontend-Related Enhancements

### Static File Testing
- **Complete static file serving test coverage** for the frontend assets
- **Test HTML serving** with proper content-type headers
- **CSS and JavaScript file serving** validation
- **404 error handling** for missing frontend assets
- **API route precedence** ensuring backend routes work correctly

### Test Environment Frontend Files
- **Created test HTML template** with basic structure
- **Test CSS styles** for content-type verification  
- **Test JavaScript file** for proper serving validation
- **Temporary file management** with automatic cleanup

### Frontend Development Support
- **Improved test reliability** for frontend integration
- **Better error messages** for frontend-related test failures
- **Isolated test environment** that doesn't interfere with actual frontend files
- **CORS testing** to ensure frontend can communicate with backend

## Testing Results
- **25 new API endpoint tests** all passing
- **Full compatibility** with existing 91+ unit tests
- **Comprehensive coverage** of all FastAPI routes
- **Static file serving validation** for frontend assets
- **Error handling verification** for robust frontend integration

## Benefits for Frontend Development
- **API contract validation** ensures frontend can rely on stable backend interface
- **Static file serving verification** confirms proper frontend asset delivery
- **Error handling testing** helps frontend implement proper error states
- **Session management validation** supports frontend state management
- **CORS configuration testing** ensures frontend can make API calls

This enhanced testing framework provides a solid foundation for both backend API reliability and frontend integration testing, making development more robust and deployment more confident.
